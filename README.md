# Rust optimization algorithms

This repository is for the research of improving researching "black-box" optimization algorithms. Its written in rust because rust doesn't sacrafice speed, so testing algorithms in higher dimensional spaces will be faster. Rust also is very fast to write on the development side.

## Todo:

- [ ] More N-D test functions.
- [ ] More algorithms to compare.
- [ ] Re-imagined PSO
- [ ] Redis-based deployment system for distributed computing and research.
